READ ME:

I wasn't able to finish it, I was able to generate the articles and everything else needed in
the ADMIN panel, but making it live for users is where I got hung up on small compile errors. 
My complete inexperience with Python really showed here. However as far as developing the site 
goes, I am quite capable of completing this assignment, I'd just need a few more days.  I was 
sick all last weekend which stopped me from working on it or well doing anything Saturday and 
Sunday, so that put me two days behind.  

But reasoning aside, I breezed through the POLL tutorial, my weakness just showed when I'd get
a error in the BROWSER or in the POWERSHELL.  Since I have no experience debugging Python code
and the BROWSER and POWERSHELL having terrible Error Explanations I got hung up on simple things
for far to long, that, when I figured it out I wanted to kick myself in the butt.

I do believe, as it is a Junior Full Stack role that I'd be more then capable to complete this,
or any other Django assignment.  As this role would put me on a team under a senior designer I am
completely confident I would have been able to breeze through this assignment as quickly as I did
the POLLS.  I really understood the TEMPLATING LANGUAGE, as its just HTML/CSS smooshed together 
with inline Django.  So getting the site to look like the wireframe, and implementing BOOTSTRAP 
I'd be able to figure out no problem. 

I look forward to the interview tomorrow still, it will be a good time and it'll still give me a
chance to demonstrate my aptitude, especially to learning a completely new language in a few days. 
Thank you, and see you tomorrow!
